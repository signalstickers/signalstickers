## About

A nice and handy gallery to browse and download sticker packs for Signal.
This site is served on [signalstickers.org](https://signalstickers.org),
directly from this GitHub repository.

## Adding a sticker pack to this site

Use the tool [Contribute](https://signalstickers.org/contribute) at the top of
`signalstickers.org`, and follow the guide!

### Contribution guidelines

We reserve the right to moderate and refuse packs or stickers. In particular:

- Stickers packs that call for hatred or violence against people or communities
  based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
  expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
  identity and orientation;
- Sticker packs that directly promote a brand or a company.

We also reserve the right to moderate packs or stickers after their submission
and acceptance.

The idea is to keep a family atmosphere: I'd like my grandmother to be able to
navigate sticker packs quietly.

## Q&A

### How can I create a sticker pack?

Follow the tutorial on the [Signal support site](https://support.signal.org/hc/articles/360031836512-Stickers#h_c2a0a45b-862f-4d12-9ab1-d9a6844062ca)
to upload your stickers to Signal.

> Note: when creating stickers, don't forget to add a white stroke to improve
> legibility on dark themes! You can use [this script](https://github.com/signalstickers/stickers-scripts/blob/master/add_border.sh)
> or use [this project](https://framagit.org/luc/stickerify-for-signal)
> to automatically resize and add a white stroke on all the PNG and WEBP images
> of a directory.

### How can I create animated stickers?

You can use our lib to create animated stickers from GIF/APNG. You can also use
the Signal Desktop app to create animated stickers from APNG files.

You can also use [some tools we provide to assist you with animated stickers creation](https://github.com/signalstickers/stickers-scripts).

> Note that support for some APNG files is [not perfect on Signal for iOS at the moment.](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/issues/4611)

### Am I required to add my sticker pack to this site to share it with my friends?

**No**. You can just send any sticker to your friends and they will be able to
install the pack, or you can share your sticker pack using the `signal.art` link
that you got when you created your sticker pack, or by using the share button
from inside the signal app's sticker managment screen.

Do not hesitate to post your pack on social networks using the hashtag
`#makeprivacystick` as well!
